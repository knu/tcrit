# Demo recordings

The README video is recorded with [VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) from `code-review.tape`; `demo.tape` records a document review without an agent.  It needs `vhs`, `tmux`, `claude`, and GNU make on `PATH`.

Run these from this directory, or from the repository root with `make -C demo`:

```bash
make            # record MP4s whose tape or scripts changed
make rebuild    # record them again from scratch
make clean      # delete the MP4s
```

Each recording runs `setup.sh`, then `vhs`, then `clean-recording.sh`.  The setup script builds the current checkout and creates the fixtures from `assets` under `$DEMO_DIR` (default `$TMPDIR/tcrit-demo`): a throwaway Git repository with staged changes, a Markdown document, the Claude Code skills with an English-only `CLAUDE.md` and the full-color `dark` theme, and an isolated `XDG_STATE_HOME` for review sessions.  The fixtures live outside the checkout because Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md` from every parent directory.  The tapes clear inherited `NO_COLOR` and enable truecolor so agent-host settings do not remove the recording colors.  The tape starts a private tmux server inside the recording so TCrit opens its pane there rather than in the multiplexer running VHS.  Both tapes source `theme.tape`, which selects the `Pro` palette shipped with macOS Terminal so the recordings show TCrit on a stock theme.  Claude Code runs as Opus 5.5 with low effort and fast mode disabled, in auto permission mode inside the fixture directory; set `DEMO_PERMISSION_MODE=bypassPermissions` before `vhs` if a permission prompt stalls the recording.  The cleanup script moves MP4 playback metadata to the front of the file for streaming.  It preserves every frame without re-encoding or reducing colors.

MP4s are local build outputs ignored by Git.  Published recordings are hosted as release assets.  After the first recording, MP4s only rebuild when a tape, script, or fixture is newer.

## Uploading recordings

Use an existing draft or published release to host recordings without adding them to Git:

```sh
./demo/release.sh -t v0.16.0 list
./demo/release.sh -t v0.16.0 upload demo/review-flow-codex.mp4 v0.16.0
```

The script requires `gh`, `jq`, and `sha256sum` or `shasum`.  Authenticate `gh` with write access to the repository first.  The repository defaults to the current repository reported by `gh repo view`.  The default release tag is `demo-assets`.  Use `-r OWNER/REPO` and `-t TAG` to select another repository or release.  The release must already exist; the script does not create tags or releases.

`list` prints tab-separated asset names, SHA-256 digests, and download URLs.  `upload FILE VERSION` accepts GIF or MP4 and preserves the extension, for example `review-flow-codex-v0.16.0.mp4`.  The version must have the form `v0.xx.x`.  An existing asset with that name is reused only when its SHA-256 and size match; different content under the same name is rejected.  Existing assets are never overwritten.  Draft releases are supported; their download links become public when the release is published.

## Sending Alt keys and mouse events from a tape

VHS accepts `Alt+p`, but its headless Chrome runs xterm.js on macOS, where Alt with a letter is not turned into an escape sequence, so the TUI receives a bare `p` (charmbracelet/vhs issue #442; `macOptionIsMeta` cannot be set from a tape).  Send the escape byte yourself instead:

```
Escape
Type "p"
```

`Type` waits after each character, not before, so the letter follows the escape within a few milliseconds and tmux delivers both in one read even with the `escape-time 10` in `tmux.conf`.  TCrit then sees `alt+p`.

Mouse events work the same way, as SGR sequences: `Escape` then `Type@1ms "[<0;COL;ROWM"` presses the left button at 1-based column and row, the same with a trailing `m` releases it, `[<64;…M` and `[<65;…M` scroll the wheel up and down, and `[<32;…M` drags.  tmux forwards them to the pane that asked for mouse reporting and converts the coordinates, so in a split add the pane's left offset or zoom the pane first.  Hit areas are exact and column widths follow the font and `Set Width`, so check a coordinate with a `Screenshot` before relying on it.
