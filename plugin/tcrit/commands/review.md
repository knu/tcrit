# Review

Ask the user what they want to review:

> What are you looking to review?
>
> 1. **Code changes** — Review changed files in a tabbed TUI with syntax highlighting and diff markers
> 2. **A document or plan** — Review a specific file in the interactive TUI

If the user chooses **code review**, invoke the `tcrit:code-review` skill.

If the user chooses **document/plan review**, ask for the file path and invoke the `tcrit:plan-review` skill with that path.
